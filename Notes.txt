TODO disable face culling for 2d objects especially when shadow mapping

TODO make projection matrix more universal, probably pass it to Renderer::Render();

This is a renderer not a game engine, data can be stored in whatever method serves best for rendering. Just needs to be generic enough
to work for any of the 4 renderers

Modify ObjectMaterialUpdate and ObjectTransformUpdate to store the index of the material or transform that is modified within the transform or material bank

Consider having a bank of materials, geometrys, and transforms per scene, and than when we load the scene we just set the apps banks
to the banks of the scene

apply gamma correction to OpenGl renderer

TODO replace Geometry name checks with primitive type checks

Lock in scene switching system, and give each scene its own material/transform/geometry banks, but also implement some kind of global asset bank
that stores models so they dont have to be reloaded

Lock in the modification of tranforms and geoemtry and materials for each renderer

TODO make a custom binary format for models and speed test it against assimp
