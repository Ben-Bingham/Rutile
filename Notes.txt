// Materials need to be reuploaded every frame
// Transforms need to be reuploaded every frame

// Lights DO NOT need to be reuploaded every frame
    // But when something changes they do need to be


// Renderer changes:
// Add on a SetLight(size_t lightIndex, Light* newLight); function that sets the light at the specified index to the new light
    // This hopes that the renderer will be able to modify only one light at a time, if not a renderer could reset them all, and have
    // initialy saved a copy of the full bundle
// Add on SetPacket(size_t packetIndex, const Packet& newPacket);  same as setlight but for packets

// IF A LIGHT IS SET TO nullptr, IT IS CONSIDERD DELETED
// IF A PACKET IS SET WITH NO VERTICES, IT IS CONSIDERD DELETED

// More renderer changes:
// Add a AddLight(Light* light); function that adds on a new light onto the end of the current list of lights;
// Add a AddPacket(Packet) function that adds on a new packet to the end of the current list;
